# QR Code Generator

This QR Code Generator is a simple Python script that generates a QR code image. 
The script uses the `qrcode` library to create the QR code. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. 
If not, download and install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```python
pip install qrcode[pil]
```


## Usage

1. Open the `qr_code_generator.py` file in a text editor.

2. Customize the `data` variable with the desired URL or information you want the QR code to contain.

3. Replace the `file_name` variable with your preferred file name and format (e.g., `qr_code.png`, `qr_code.jpg`, or `qr_code.svg`).

4. Save your changes and close the text editor.

5. Run the script by navigating to the directory where the `qr_code_generator.py` file is located, and execute the following command:

```python
python qr_code_generator.py
```


6. The QR code image will be generated and saved in the same directory as the script.

7. Add the QR code image to your promotional flyer using your preferred graphic design software or online design tool (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Canva, or Microsoft Publisher).

8. Test the QR code by scanning it with a smartphone or QR code reader app to ensure it works correctly and directs users to the intended destination.
